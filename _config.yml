user_description: <i> "In this world, there are things you can only do alone, and things you can only do with someone else. It's important to combine the two in just the right ammount"</i> <br/> Move to <a href="home.iitk.ac.in/~mohitmk">other website</a> for a non-technical and more fun but visually unappealing(arguable) website. I'm a "Mathematics and Scientific Computing" student at IIT Kanpur, always searching for the next challenge. Being a sophomore at college, I have been immersed in exploring various domains of science and life alike. Current interest areas include <i>Neuroscience, Robotics, Computer Vision, Cognitive Science, Deep Learning, Music, Philosophy etc</i>. I hope to do a project(blog post coming soon, hopefully) on each of these topics to get a better understanding. <br/><big>I would love to talk with you, so feel free to drop a message on any of the social media.</big>
